# movie_api_analysis

In this project, I gathered data on the 10 best picture Oscar-winning movies from a movie API then analyzed the data using JupyterLab. In the project files that I received, I used a list of 10 Oscar-winning movies and their IMDB ids. I had to gather data on these movies for an analysis. Using the OMDb API and the IMDB ids from the CSV, I gathered the data on each movie and saved the information into a CSV file. Then answered a few questions about the data using JupyterLab.
